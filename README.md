# Musical Chairs

A gem for swapping in/out document folders in iOS Sims

## Setup

    gem install chairs

The first time you run it, chairs will ask you to add "chairs/" to your .gitignore file if you have one, you should accept this, it gets big fast.

## Usage

Run `chairs` from the root folder of your project.

        chairs pull [name]        get the docs file from most recent app and call it name.
        chairs push [name]        move the named docs to the most recent app doc folder.
        chairs list               list all the current docs in working directory.
        chairs help               show in app help.
